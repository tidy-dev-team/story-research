# Text Button Component

The Text Button component is a minimal UI element for triggering secondary actions or navigation without drawing too much attention away from the main content of the interface. It's presented as a simple text link with blue color.

## Features

- Clean, text-only design with a blue color
- Support for leading and trailing icons
- RTL (right-to-left) text direction support
- Accessible focus states
- Disabled state

## Import

```jsx
import { TextButton } from './path/to/TextButton';
import LanguageIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Language';
```

## Basic Usage

```jsx
// Basic text button
<TextButton label="Learn more" />

// With click handler
<TextButton 
  label="Visit FAQ" 
  onClick={() => navigateToFAQ()} 
/>
```

## With Icons

Text buttons can include leading and/or trailing icons.

```jsx
// With leading icon
<TextButton 
  label="Visit Website" 
  leadingIcon={<LanguageIcon sx={{ fontSize: "14px" }} />} 
/>

// With trailing icon
<TextButton 
  label="Next Page" 
  trailingIcon={<ArrowForwardIcon sx={{ fontSize: "14px" }} />} 
/>

// With both icons
<TextButton 
  label="Open Audio" 
  leadingIcon={<HeadphonesIcon sx={{ fontSize: "14px" }} />}
  trailingIcon={<ArrowForwardIcon sx={{ fontSize: "14px" }} />}
/>
```

## States

### Disabled

```jsx
<TextButton label="Disabled" disabled />
```

### Focus

The text button shows a focus ring when it receives keyboard focus or when the `focused` prop is true.

```jsx
<TextButton label="Focused" focused />
```

## RTL Support

For right-to-left languages, set the `rtl` prop to `true`.

```jsx
<TextButton 
  label="טקסט" 
  rtl={true} 
/>
```

## Event Handling

```jsx
<TextButton 
  label="Click Me" 
  onClick={(e) => {
    console.log('Text button clicked', e);
    // Handle the click event
  }} 
/>
```

## Interactive Example

Try modifying the properties below to see the text button change in real-time:

<Canvas>
  <Story of={TextButtonStories.Interactive} />
</Canvas>

## Component Props

<Controls />

## Accessibility

- Implements standard button behavior with keyboard navigation support
- Focus states are clearly visible
- When used with icons, maintains proper contrast and readability

## Design Considerations

- Use Text buttons for secondary actions or navigation links
- Text buttons take up minimal space and are visually light
- Use them for actions that don't need to be highlighted
- Always include clear, concise text labels for better accessibility
- Consider using TextButton for low-emphasis actions, where standard Button might be too prominent
  label="Click Me" 
  onClick={(e) => {
    console.log('Button clicked', e);
    // Handle the click event
  }} 
/>
```

## Accessibility

- Implements standard button behavior with keyboard navigation support
- Focus states are clearly visible
- When used with icons, maintains proper contrast and readability

## Design Considerations

- Use Text buttons for low-emphasis actions, where standard Button might be too prominent
- Text buttons are good for navigation, secondary actions, or less important operations 
- Ideal for settings, "Learn more" links, and tertiary options
- Always include clear, concise text labels for better accessibility
- Consider the visual hierarchy - text buttons should have less emphasis than regular buttons
