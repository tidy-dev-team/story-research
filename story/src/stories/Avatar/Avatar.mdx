# Avatar Component

The Avatar component is used to display a user's profile picture or initials as a circular element. It supports different sizes and can display a text label (e.g., initials) or a fallback "N/A" if no label is provided. The background color changes based on whether a label is present.

## Features

- Displays a circular avatar.
- Supports multiple sizes: Small (`sm`), Medium (`md`), and Large (`lg`).
- Shows a text `label` (e.g., initials) if provided.
- Displays "N/A" as a fallback if no `label` is provided.
- Background color differs for avatars with a label (filled) versus those without (unfilled).
- Built with Tailwind CSS and class-variance-authority for styling.

## Import

```tsx
import Avatar, { AvatarSize } from './path/to/Avatar';
```

## Basic Usage

Provide a `label` for initials and a `size`.

```tsx
// Small Avatar with initials
<Avatar label="JD" size={AvatarSize.Sm} />

// Medium Avatar, no label (shows "N/A")
<Avatar size={AvatarSize.Md} />

// Large Avatar with initials
<Avatar label="AB" size={AvatarSize.Lg} />
```
