# story-research

This is a demo repo for Storybook using React and Tailwind CSS.

## How to use:

First get into the project folder by running this command in Terminal:
```bash
cd story
```

Then open the project main page by running this:
```bash
sudo npm run dev
```

Or get right into the Storybook like this:
```bash
npm run storybook
```

If something doesn't work, make sure you're in the right folder (story) or try running the commands with ```sudo``` at the start.
